# Setting up a new deep learning station with Python 3.6, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV using Ubuntu 16.04 on a Google Cloud VM instance

This repository contains step-by-step instructions for creating a deep learning station under Ubuntu 16.04. In my case I created it on a Google Cloud VM instance, so I included the instructions for settting up this instance in Step 1. If you are looking to use a local machine or a different cloud (e.g. AWS), I suppose you should still be able to use steps 2 - 10 for your setup.

The total time that you should expect to spend on this installation is 2.5 - 3 hours. Most of this time will be spent on building and installing OpenCV, which is only necessary for working with images. If you don't need OpenCV, please skip steps 3, 5, and 7-9. 

I have verified that these instructions work when followed as suggested as of April 17, 2018. The behavior of some download links and other features may change in the future. I will update this tutorial in case if I become aware of any issues. However, I am not planning to test it regularly to confirm that it still works.
